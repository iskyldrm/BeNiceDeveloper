## 🎯 Learning Path

1. Start with **CSharp-Basics** - Get comfortable with the language
2. Move to **OOP-Concepts** - Learn object-oriented programming
3. Practice with **Collections** - Master data structures
4. Explore **LINQ** - Learn powerful querying capabilities
5. Dive into **Async-Programming** - Handle concurrent operations

## 📝 Practice Tips

- Write code examples for each concept
- Create small console applications to test your understanding
- Use debugging tools to understand code execution
- Practice with different scenarios and edge cases

## 🎯 Milestones

- [ ] Complete basic C# syntax exercises
- [ ] Build a simple OOP-based console application
- [ ] Practice with all major collection types
- [ ] Write LINQ queries for various scenarios
- [ ] Create an async application (e.g., file downloader)
